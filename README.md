# Welcome to Margot's Repository

## Who Am I?
I'm Margot, the Social Media Manager at the University of Antwerp. I have a diverse background in press and communications, web design, and social media coaching.

## What's This Repo About?
This repository hosts various projects related to my Master's in Digital Text Analysis. Expect to see a range of code snippets and full-blown projects that explore data visualization and natural language processing.

## Fun Facts
- I have a deep appreciation for movies, so if you notice some cinematic references in my code, you're on the right track.
- I enjoy video games, often finding parallels between game strategies and life's challenges.
- I studied Dutch, Theater, Literature, and Film Sciences from 2007-2012, making me a Jill-of-all-trades in the humanities.

## Get in Touch
If you'd like to collaborate, offer suggestions, or simply say hello, feel free to reach out. I'm open to both academic and light-hearted discussions.
